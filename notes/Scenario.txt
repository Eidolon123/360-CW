Scenario
    • Yotsuba Group are a manufacturer specialising in <insert product here>
    • Expanding rapidly with currently 290 employees. Assume +20% per year? Therefore, design needs scalability
    • Currently performance is deteriorating rapidly, assume this is bandwidth issues? Could utilise redundancy, having many physical links appear as one logical link
    • Concerned about security issues, what could these issues be? Connecting external devices? Look into ensuring port security.
    • New building has 8 floors and a 2-floor underground car park, potential uses (or risks) for the car park? Separate VLANs for each floor, e.g., a different department per floor?
    • Each employee needs a desktop plus a phone, landline phone? Some employees also have laptops so needs to be kept in mind for addressing space.
    • Top floor is for directors, personal assistants and heads. High value assets on this floor, increased security risk?
    • IT department is located on ground floor, think of other risks associated with this
    • Ground floor should also provide Wi-Fi and desktops for personal use so separate firewall, less monitoring?
