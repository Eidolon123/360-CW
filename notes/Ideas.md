# Ideas

- Floor plans (how big can building be)
- Ipv6 implementation
- Regulations for design of building and network in Japan
- Secure server room
- Wi-Fi AP on each floor (ranges of these)
- Seperate VLAN for each floor?
- Specific devices and speeds
- Packet tracer diagrams
- Estimated costs of the solution
- Need to ensure port security
- Top floor is for directors, personal assistants and heads. High value assets on this floor, increased security risk?
- Performance is degrading. Utilise redundancy, having many physical links appear as one logical link
- Some employees also have laptops so needs to be kept in mind for addressing space
- IT department is located on ground floor, think of other risks associated with this
- Ground floor should also provide Wi-Fi and desktops for personal use so separate firewall, less monitoring?
