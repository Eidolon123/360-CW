\chapter{Disaster Plan}
\section{Outline and Scope}
This disaster management and contingency plan aims to identify risks and provide methods of mitigation. Certain issues can be treated with automation via the setup of executables using the Intermapper network management software. If manual intervention is required, the plan employs a systematic approach, which allows problems to be treated in a sufficient timeframe, but with enough knowledge so that it can be understood and corrected properly. We have been proactive with our network design, employing the Cisco 3-layer hierarchical model to prevent issues and help with troubleshooting. Our design makes it easier to isolate a section of the network where an issue may be found, makes scaling easier and ensures we have redundancy within the network.

    Fire                                                 & Destruction or damage to critical IT infrastructure. Damage to company reputation                            & Conduct regular fire assessments, ensuring sockets are PAT tested and fire extinguishers are readily available.                                                                                                                    \\ \hline
