\subsection{Layer 3 Switch - Distribution}
\subsubsection{Chassis - C4506-E}
\subsubsection{Line Card - Something with fiber}
\subsection{Layer 2 Switch - Access}
\subsubsection{Chassis - C9404R}
\subsubsection{Line Card - C9400-LC-48XS}
Smaller form factor than counter parts, allows for higher port density.
\subsubsection{Supervisor Card - C9400-SUP-1XL-Y}
Allows for 10Gbps on each port.
\subsubsection{Router -  Cisco 4000 Series Integrated Services Router}

\section{Wiring}
\subsection{Fibre}
A full fiber solution will be employed for this network to account for future proofing and less noise on the network.
\subsubsection{Multimode Fiber - OM4}
Current network will be 10GBASE-SR, using OM4 fiber will give us options to expand to 40GBASE-SR or 100GBASE-SR in future.
Could be used in and between core/access due to high data transfer rates (10Gbps) over a distance of 550m.\\
While the distance of 550m is overkill for a 7 story building, the allowance for higher distances at higher speeds (100m at 100Gbps) will be good for futurproofing our solution.\\
Cost of fiber is reducing as time passes, basically as cheap as ethernet at this point.\\
OM4 would be used due to the cost/benifit compared to OM5 which would be overkill for our setup.\\
Will incure an additional cost of installing fiber optic enabled network cards in workstations.\\

    Type & Distance for a 10Gbps connection & Cost per meter \\ \hline
    OM1  & 33m                              &                \\ \hline

\section{Device Placement}
Change numbers of legal, marketing, finance and personnel to match google doc numbers.
\subsection{Patch Pannels}
Patch pannels could be placed on each floor to house access section L2 switches.
