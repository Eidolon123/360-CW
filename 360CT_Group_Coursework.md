0. Introduction â€“ keep it brief, including structure, presentation, writing style, etc.


1. Explain the requirements gathering process and the assumptions made about the company, the buildings, and other parameters of the problem. If necessary, provide diagrams such as floor plans.


2. Propose devices that could be used for implementing your design, discussing the physical topology, wiring and device placement.


3. Present your network design (including any plans to support expansion in the future). Provide a topology diagram and justify your design decisions.


4. Design an appropriate addressing scheme and discuss/explain/justify this design.
